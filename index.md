### Mental Pain: 5.5 Physical Pain: 4

I woke up very late today. I set the alarm for 5:30 AM, but was only able to defeat the seductiveness of my bed at 8:00 AM. That's very late for me. It's 9:20 AM now, and I am anxiously waiting for the transit bus to come. My mental pain is not as severe this morning. It's either that it's too early for me to tell, or I'm a psychologically drained from yesterday. Yesterday was so full of emotions, and my tiny brain is exhausted. We'll see how things go from here. The sports doctor's appointment is at 10:05 AM. I should be heading out now.  

This new doc turned to be my new favorite person. She was late to my appointment, but she was quick, punctual, very knowledgeable and attractive. The last characterization is always a plus no matter who you are. She told me to stop taking muscle relaxers and ditch the physical therapy. I was ecstatic to hear that since I never got along with Brandon (is that his name?) to begin with. Instead, she prescribed me some bomb-ass steroids (I don't know the real clinical name of the drug) to treat what I finally know my problem as "lumbar strain." My mood has really uplifted since the minute I swallowed them delicious tablets. I didn't arrive at the verge of tears by the the time 4 o'clock rolled around like yesterday, and I had enough energy left to continue tutoring kids. Pain has been manageable all day. 

During the tutoring hours, I talked to the girl who has been one of my deepest sources of depression. I was worried she wouldn't talk to me for all the terrible stuff I did to her. It was our first encounter in two weeks, (when things got really heated), but we had a very cordial small chat. I think that constitutes as a happy closure in our acquaintanceship. That felt alright and now I don't have to worry about her hating me eternally.

Another thing that I did today was e-mail my old therapist. I sent her an e-mail asking if she offered counseling over vitual conferencing. I have yet to hear back from her. I loved Michele. She knew all about my fucked up history, like how I had a fetish for girls in relationships, my burgenoning drinking problems and how I was molested in 1st grade.

I got home at 6:00 PM and noticed that my Washburn was depressed. Well. I guess I don't play him as much as I used to, so he's obviously lonely. I only know and compose sad, four-chord songs, so I figured it's not good for my sanity to continue my relationship with him. Besides, I can't muster any strength on my fingertips to hold down 'em dirty-old-perverted steel strings. And I don't have the drive to learn new chord progressions. I've been hoping to learn Jazz guitar, but I just suck at life right now.

Overall, I felt today was a good day. I regained some of my sanity and strength. I'm starting to speculate that maybe the physical pain in one's body is a huge, if not, the larges tdriving factor in one's mental pain. Maybe.

### Mental Pain: 9.5 Physical Pain: 7

I panicked hard today. So, I reached out to a few friends on the phone and spam messaged a few others. And guess what? They all happen to love me. My genius soon-to-be-doctor friend, Niki, told me to keep track of levels of mental and physical pain daily. Hence, the numbers followed by the date. My angelic friend, Bri, writes so beautifully. Her writing makes me cry often. She inspired me to add some body of text followed by the numbers. Her twin brother, Nick, is a role model for me. He's moving to a new apartment with his finacee soon, and I showed my excitement for his new chapter in life. My ever-hilarious, optimist friend, Hewett, took time out of his busy work schedule to play a childish mobile game with me. That was so kind of him. My sweet friend, Julian, is gay. He was the last person I talked to today. He wants to me check out a therapist messaging service that I don't necessarily trust.

I suffered a severe back muscle spasm exactly 8 days ago. I still haven't recovered from it. I've been going to a series of doctor's appointments and started attending physical therapy. I have to say, I don't really like my physical therapist, Brandon (I can't remember if that's even his name). 

I suffer from chronic depression, but these past few weeks have really hit it hard for me. But I think that's a story for another time. This daily summary is getting too long. So I guess this is a journal, but not really because that wasn't my intention. Whatever.

I want to get better. I want my back to heal faster, and I want to be free of this thing called depression that's haunted me all my life. I'm not sure if writing helps in any way, but I'm willing to give it a try.
