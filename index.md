### Mental Pain: 4 Physical Pain: 0.5

[8:02 AM] I woke up with no pain this morning. Just a little sad with life. I'm supposed to be on meloxicam from now on, but I don't see the point of taking it. I have no pain.

### Mental Pain: 4 Physical Pain: 1.5

[2:27 PM] I took the last dose of steroid this morning. I have been incredibly unhappy about the effects of the steroid the last couple days, so I'm glad it's finally over. Upon prescribing the drug, the sports doc failed to mention all the side effects that comes with this particular steroid, one of them being incredible mood swings. And I'm already addicted to depression.

[4:30 PM] I napped, woke up, walked to the cafe, had a scone, and came back. It's my desperate attempt to spark and motivate myself to work. Oof. I don't think the storm is going away any time soon. But I feel calmer than this morning. It's probably because I took a nap. I don't know.

### Mental Pain: 3 Physical Pain: 3.0

[12:59 PM] I'm at a cafe. It's really the only cafe I go to that's not on campus. It's close from home, and you have to cross a really cute bridge to get there. Coffee happens to be cheap, so that's an added perk. My mental pain went up this morning. As expected, yesterday was just a day. I hadn't weathered the storm, and the "sun" was just a tease in the clouds. The uncontrollable happiness was probably just a side effect of the steroid. I'm in the tapering phase of the prescription right now, so I feel the effect of steroid less and less. Perhaps that's why mental pain has gone up. It seems to be a clear inverse relationship.

I'm not happy that my muscles have not healed yet. There is still a non-insignificant amount of pain in the back, and I worry that this may become a chronic condition. I already have a permanently messed up right shoulder because I was in a fight once. And when I say fight, I don't mean the one where both parties beat the crap out of each other until one comes out on top. I mean the one where one guy lets the other guy punch him until the guy who didn't throw punches falls down. I was that one guy. It was at a pickup hockey game in 2016, when an idiot decided to attack me for no reason, and I decided to practice Penn Jillette's extreme pacifism. I ate punches and walked out feeling proud for my abstinence from retaliation. That's how I ended up with a permanently damaged shoulder. I hope I don't end up with a permanently damaged back. Hunchbacks just aren't cool. 

Elaborating on the mental pain, I feel that I've fallen into the attractor of guilt once again. It's the cycle of regret that has tormented me for weeks now. Endlessly reminding myself of the shame and guilt of being a "less than a decent man." Endlessly dreaming of new sequences of events that would have avoided all the pain and turmoil. Endlessly imagining things that will never come true. 

It's hard to break out of the cycle. No. I don't know if I ever can and will as long as the climate is still "stormy." I did develop a few techniques to temporarily overcome the attractor though. I read and reread Jocko's poem over and over again. And then, I read out loud my daily reminders:

>  _No mas_
>
>  Be kinder
>
>  Be stronger
>
>  Tell your friends you love them
>
>  Because they love you
>
>  Determinism + Randomness

Today is just another hard day. Despite the relatively low level of mental pain, it feels so much worse given the mental health peak from yesterday. We'll see where today leads me.

[3:22 PM] I can't get myself to work. Although, I'm listening to a lot of music out in the balcony again, trying to soak up some of the last glimmer of sun, I guess. I changed my mental pain level from 2 to 3. Now I'm more than convinced that I didn't even come close to weathering the storm. It was just a single tornadoe gone by. I can see a bigger storm coming a mile away, and I'm terrified.

### Mental Pain: 0.5 Physical Pain: 3.5

[2:24 PM] Do I dare say that my depression is completely gone? Definitely not. But I'm in a great place right now. Much better mental place than the last few weeks. It's 55 degrees, sunny, absolutely beautiful, and I wish I could share with the whole world. I'm soaking up the sun in my balcony, sitting on something called "wicker" chair. It's a southern style wooden chair with a back support that is woven from wicker material. My feet are resting on a dusty trash can. I'm also sipping on some canned, pink grapefruit Perrier in between typing. Is this what happiness is? I don't know, but I feel good. Amazingly good. It's only one day, but I feel like I found the metaphorical "sun" Jocko was referring to. I've weathered the storm. And now, I'm enjoying my day just typing away. What has changed? I wish I knew. 

I'm still having a hard time focusing though. I believe the steroid is the main culprit. My brain is operating at the speed of light, and I can't formulate sentences that are longer than 10 words. Plus, the back pain is still there. It's odd. I would've bet all of my life's savings that I would've started recovering from the physical injury faster than the mental one. Now, I'm not saying that I'm healed. I don't doubt for a second that the storm will come back later today or sometime this weekend, when I'm alone. But all I want to do right now is just enjoy my little moment of sun. And in 10 minutes, I will head out for a quick skate, possibly for the last time this season. Spring is here.

### Mental Pain: 2.5 Physical Pain: 4

[4:58 PM] The steroid is causing problems for me. I got very little sleep the last two days. Tuesday night, I must have slept for about 5 hours. Last night, I slept for less than 3. The physical pain was mostly absent in the morning, but resurfaced in the afternoon. I had to head home earlier than I hoped because of the pain. 

[9:04 PM] I'm in a much better place today. Mentally stronger. Happier. And I feel like I can finally sleep.

### Mental Pain: 5.5 Physical Pain: 2

With the new steroid treatment, I've been feeling very little pain. One side-effect, however, seems to be heightened sense of awareness, and that's just a euphemism for no sleep. I couldn't sleep last night. I was awake until 2:00 AM, which is unacceptably late for me. But an unexpected positive outcome of that was that I ended up listened to hours and hours of Jocko Willink podcast and found a gem that put me in a better headspace.

>  The storm that you’re in, it is hard to see out of that storm. It’s hard to see past it. It seems like the storm is everything. But the storm is not everything. And it won’t last forever. You can get out of the storm, and you will get out of the storm. And when you get out… you’re gonna see the sun, again.

> But right now, you’re being tried. You’re being forged. You’re being tested by fire and by pain. That’s the test. Don’t fail the test. Don’t fail the test. Don’t give in. Don’t quit. Don’t ever quit.

> Fight on. Fight through the storm. Fight through the pain, and come out the other side stronger and tougher and better. A fighter. A survivor. A winner. Victorious. And free from that storm. Free from the darkness. Free.

What a beaut. I created a poster of this for my room with some other stuff. 

I cried in my office this morning. My friend, Krittika, is a gentle soul and happens to be the girlfriend of my best friend. She and I have a lot in common including our constant search for better mindfulness, so we text each other frequently. Being a concerned, kind, caring person that she is, she inquired about how I was doing. So I spilled everything. We talked about when my recent struggles began. When things got really bad. What happened with the _girl_, and how I am repenting for my sins. I told her that I can't function like a normal. I sought advice from her. I also told her that I loved her and her boyfriend (my best friend) dearly. I cried as I was typing those words. I love my friends so much. Sometimes I feel like an ungrateful bastard because I take my friends for granted, and fail to realize that they will always be there for me. There is a reason why this journal/blog/thing(?) is called "myfriendsloveme."

Once I got home, I lied in bed and stared at the ceiling for a good hour. I didn't think of anything particular. I just lied there. I was just happy that I wasn't at school and was home at a quiet place where I could rest my head and back. My cat, Billy, comforted my chest and the crotch meanwhile. After an hour of empty staring, I decided to lift. I was trying to play a mental mind trick on myself that the methylprednisolone I'm taking helps with body building. I'm a 133 lb toothpick so I need to lift and get bigger. I did 4 sets of bench press at 80 lbs. I don't remember the rep count. I sucked. 

[3:35 PM] I decided that I should start time stamping to organize thoughts chronologically. When I'm writing, I'm like a kid on adderall. I just write whatever pops into my head. Like. I'm gonna write about how I'm expecting a call from Niki at 5:00 PM. I'm expecting a call from Niki at 5:00 PM. I think I'm gonna walk around a bit before the phone call. It's nice outside.

### Mental Pain: 5.5 Physical Pain: 4

I woke up very late today. I set the alarm for 5:30 AM, but was only able to defeat the seductiveness of my bed at 8:00 AM. That's very late for me. It's 9:20 AM now, and I am anxiously waiting for the transit bus to come. My mental pain is not as severe this morning. It's either that it's too early for me to tell, or I'm still psychologically drained from yesterday. Yesterday was so full of emotions, and my tiny brain is exhausted. We'll see how things go from here. The sports doctor's appointment is at 10:05 AM. I should be heading out now.  

This sports doc turned out to be my new favorite person. She was late to my appointment, but she was quick, punctual, very knowledgeable and attractive. The last characterization is always a plus no matter who you are. She told me to stop taking muscle relaxers and ditch the physical therapy. I was ecstatic to hear that since I never got along with Brandon (is that his name?) to begin with. Instead, she prescribed me some bomb-ass steroids (I don't know the real clinical name of the drug) to treat what I finally know my problem as "lumbar strain." My mood has really uplifted since the minute I swallowed them delicious tablets. I didn't arrive at the verge of tears by the the time 4 o'clock rolled around like yesterday, and I had enough energy left to continue tutoring kids. Pain was manageable all day. 

During the tutoring hours, I talked to the _girl_ who has been one of my deepest sources of depression. I was worried she wouldn't talk to me for all the terrible stuff I did to her. It was our first encounter in two weeks, (when things got really heated), but we had a very cordial small chat. I think that constitutes as a happy closure in our acquaintanceship. That felt alright, and now I don't have to worry about her hating me eternally.

Another thing that I did today was e-mail my old therapist. I shot her an e-mail asking if she offered counseling over virtual conferencing. I have yet to hear back from her. I loved Michele. She knew all about my fucked up history, like how I had a fetish for girls in relationships, my burgeoning drinking problems and how I was molested in 1st grade.

I got home at 6:00 PM and noticed that my Washburn was going through depression as well. Well. I guess I don't play him as much as I used to, so he's obviously lonely. I only know and compose sad, four-chord songs, so I figured it's not good for my sanity to continue my relationship with him. Besides, I can't muster any strength on my fingertips to hold down 'em dirty-old-perverted steel strings. And I don't have the drive to learn new chord progressions. I've been hoping to learn Jazz guitar, but I just suck at life right now.

Overall, I felt today was a good day. I regained some of my sanity and strength. I'm starting to speculate that maybe the physical pain in one's body is a huge, if not, the biggest driving factor in one's mental pain. Maybe.

### Mental Pain: 9.5 Physical Pain: 7

I panicked hard today. So, I reached out to a few friends on the phone and spam messaged a few others. And guess what? They all happen to love me. My genius soon-to-be-doctor friend, Niki, told me to keep track of levels of mental and physical pain daily. Hence, the numbers followed by the date. My angelic friend, Bri, writes so beautifully. Her writing makes me cry often. She inspired me to add some body of text followed by the numbers. Her twin brother, Nick, is a role model for me. He's moving to a new apartment with his fiancee soon, and I showed my excitement for his new chapter in life. My ever-hilarious, optimist friend, Hewett, took time out of his busy work schedule to play a childish mobile game with me. That was so kind of him. My sweet friend, Julian, is gay. He was the last person I talked to today. He wants to me check out a therapist messaging service that I don't necessarily trust.

I suffered a severe back muscle spasm exactly 8 days ago. I still haven't recovered from it. I've been going to a series of doctor's appointments and started attending physical therapy. I have to say, I don't really like my physical therapist, Brandon (I can't remember if that's even his name). 

I suffer from chronic depression, but these past few weeks have really hit it hard for me. But I think that's a story for another time. This daily summary is getting too long. So I guess this is a journal, but not really because that wasn't my intention. Whatever.

I want to get better. I want my back to heal faster, and I want to be free of this thing called depression that's haunted me all my life. I'm not sure if writing helps in any way, but I'm willing to give it a try.
