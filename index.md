### Mental Pain: 5.5 Physical Pain: 2

With the new steroid treatment, I've been feeling very little pain. One side-effect, however, seems to be heightened sense of awareness, and that's just a euphemism for no sleep. I couldn't sleep last night. I was awake until 2:00 AM, which is unacceptably late for me. But an unexpected positive outcome of that was that I ended up listened to hours and hours of Jocko Willink podcast and found a gem that put me in a better headspace.

>  The storm that you’re in, it is hard to see out of that storm. It’s hard to see past it. It seems like the storm is everything. But the storm is not everything. And it won’t last forever. You can get out of the storm, and you will get out of the storm. And when you get out… you’re gonna see the sun, again.

> But right now, you’re being tried. You’re being forged. You’re being tested by fire and by pain. That’s the test. Don’t fail the test. Don’t fail the test. Don’t give in. Don’t quit. Don’t ever quit.

> Fight on. Fight through the storm. Fight through the pain, and come out the other side stronger and tougher and better. A fighter. A survivor. A winner. Victorious. And free from that storm. Free from the darkness. Free.

What a beaut. I created a poster of this for my room with some other stuff. 

I cried in my office this morning. My friend, Krittika, is a gentle soul and happens to be the girlfriend of my best friend. She and I have a lot in common including our constant search for better mindfulness, so we text each other frequently. Being a concerned, kind, caring person that she is, she inquired about how I was doing. So I spilled everything. We talked about when my recent struggles began. When things got really bad. What happened with the _girl_, and how I am repenting for my sins. I told her that I can't function like a normal. I sought advice from her. I also told her that I loved her and her boyfriend (my best friend) dearly. I cried as I was typing those words. I love my friends so much. Sometimes I feel like an ungrateful bastard because I take my friends for granted, and fail to realize that they will always be there for me. There is a reason why this journal/blog/thing(?) is called "myfriendsloveme."

Once I got home, I lied in bed and stared at the ceiling for a good hour. I didn't think of anything particular. I just lied there. I was just happy that I wasn't at school and was home at a quiet place where I could rest my head and back. My cat, Billy, comforted my chest and the crotch meanwhile. After an hour of empty staring, I decided to lift. I was trying to play a mental mind trick on myself that the methylprednisolone I'm taking helps with body building. I'm a 133 lb toothpick so I need to lift and get bigger. I did 4 sets of bench press at 80 lbs. I don't remember the rep count. I sucked. 

[3:35 PM] I decided that I should start time stamping to organzie thoughts chronologically. When I'm writing, I'm like a kid on adderall. I just write whatever pops into my head. Like. I'm gonna write about how I'm expecting a call from Niki at 5:00 PM. I'm expecting a call from Niki at 5:00 PM. I think I'm gonna walk around a bit before the phone call. It's nice outside.

### Mental Pain: 5.5 Physical Pain: 4

I woke up very late today. I set the alarm for 5:30 AM, but was only able to defeat the seductiveness of my bed at 8:00 AM. That's very late for me. It's 9:20 AM now, and I am anxiously waiting for the transit bus to come. My mental pain is not as severe this morning. It's either that it's too early for me to tell, or I'm still psychologically drained from yesterday. Yesterday was so full of emotions, and my tiny brain is exhausted. We'll see how things go from here. The sports doctor's appointment is at 10:05 AM. I should be heading out now.  

This sports doc turned out to be my new favorite person. She was late to my appointment, but she was quick, punctual, very knowledgeable and attractive. The last characterization is always a plus no matter who you are. She told me to stop taking muscle relaxers and ditch the physical therapy. I was ecstatic to hear that since I never got along with Brandon (is that his name?) to begin with. Instead, she prescribed me some bomb-ass steroids (I don't know the real clinical name of the drug) to treat what I finally know my problem as "lumbar strain." My mood has really uplifted since the minute I swallowed them delicious tablets. I didn't arrive at the verge of tears by the the time 4 o'clock rolled around like yesterday, and I had enough energy left to continue tutoring kids. Pain was manageable all day. 

During the tutoring hours, I talked to the _girl_ who has been one of my deepest sources of depression. I was worried she wouldn't talk to me for all the terrible stuff I did to her. It was our first encounter in two weeks, (when things got really heated), but we had a very cordial small chat. I think that constitutes as a happy closure in our acquaintanceship. That felt alright, and now I don't have to worry about her hating me eternally.

Another thing that I did today was e-mail my old therapist. I shot her an e-mail asking if she offered counseling over virtual conferencing. I have yet to hear back from her. I loved Michele. She knew all about my fucked up history, like how I had a fetish for girls in relationships, my burgeoning drinking problems and how I was molested in 1st grade.

I got home at 6:00 PM and noticed that my Washburn was going through depression as well. Well. I guess I don't play him as much as I used to, so he's obviously lonely. I only know and compose sad, four-chord songs, so I figured it's not good for my sanity to continue my relationship with him. Besides, I can't muster any strength on my fingertips to hold down 'em dirty-old-perverted steel strings. And I don't have the drive to learn new chord progressions. I've been hoping to learn Jazz guitar, but I just suck at life right now.

Overall, I felt today was a good day. I regained some of my sanity and strength. I'm starting to speculate that maybe the physical pain in one's body is a huge, if not, the biggest driving factor in one's mental pain. Maybe.

### Mental Pain: 9.5 Physical Pain: 7

I panicked hard today. So, I reached out to a few friends on the phone and spam messaged a few others. And guess what? They all happen to love me. My genius soon-to-be-doctor friend, Niki, told me to keep track of levels of mental and physical pain daily. Hence, the numbers followed by the date. My angelic friend, Bri, writes so beautifully. Her writing makes me cry often. She inspired me to add some body of text followed by the numbers. Her twin brother, Nick, is a role model for me. He's moving to a new apartment with his fiancee soon, and I showed my excitement for his new chapter in life. My ever-hilarious, optimist friend, Hewett, took time out of his busy work schedule to play a childish mobile game with me. That was so kind of him. My sweet friend, Julian, is gay. He was the last person I talked to today. He wants to me check out a therapist messaging service that I don't necessarily trust.

I suffered a severe back muscle spasm exactly 8 days ago. I still haven't recovered from it. I've been going to a series of doctor's appointments and started attending physical therapy. I have to say, I don't really like my physical therapist, Brandon (I can't remember if that's even his name). 

I suffer from chronic depression, but these past few weeks have really hit it hard for me. But I think that's a story for another time. This daily summary is getting too long. So I guess this is a journal, but not really because that wasn't my intention. Whatever.

I want to get better. I want my back to heal faster, and I want to be free of this thing called depression that's haunted me all my life. I'm not sure if writing helps in any way, but I'm willing to give it a try.
