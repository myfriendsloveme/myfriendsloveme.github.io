[12:42 PM] I couldn't write much because I was traveling. Oh well. I'm listening to the audiobook of one of Haruki Murakami books, "Kafka on the Shore." Meditation, no sugar, frugality, and work out regimes are going well though.

### Mental Pain: 0 Physical Pain: 3.0 Sleep Hours: 12:00 PM ~ 8:00 AM

[5:53 PM] I keep finding myself in a vicious cycle. I don't have too many obligations, now it's the Summer. This relaxed pace puts me in  a constant state of boredom. Boredom leads to me thinking about other things, like hatred for some people. I find all of these so problematic. I understand that mindfulness is the tool I should be employing here. But I'm only human. 

Today's accomplishments:

* Meditated
* No sugar
* Journal 
* No spending
* Working out

Today's failures:

* Waking up at 4:30 AM 
* 4 + 4 hours of research

[6:12 PM] I pulled another muscle yesterday. I was working on my goal of perofriming a handstand pushup, but ended up pulling a muscle. The frequency of innjuries I suffer unfortunately seems to increase as I get older. The mankind has worked forever to defy death. Defy aging. But it's always been futile. I seem to be no exception. I worry that my back will never be the same. I worry that I will never be as athletic as I used to be. I worry that my personal fitness goals have shattered before I could even begin. It's truly dejectintg. However, I haven't lost my drive. The Summer is here, and I am full of aspirations.

I wrote a clumsy list yesterday, but here is a more organized list of things I want to achieve and how I will achieve them:

1. I want to be accomplished: I want to publish a lot of quality articles to break into academy. 
 * This will entail working on research every day 8 hours a week, with a **4 hour split on the two projects for the next 6 months**.          
2. I want to be stronger. 
 * That will entail waking up early in the morning **(4:30 AM), exercising at least 6 times a week, keeping track of the BMI and progress.**
 * Split the workout days by alternating between upper and lower body exercises. For the upper body, max out on fitness goals: bench press, diamond pushups, dips, curls, leg raises (in order). For the lower body, squat, run, and do planks as needed.
 * **Cut down on sugar.** You can have one cheat day every two weeks. 
3. I want to improve on my artistic side: Jazz guitar
 * **Practice at least 40 minutes a day**
4. I want to be kinder.
 * **Walk dogs at least once a week.** 
5. I want to be frugal.
 * **Spend only what's needed.** Always explore alternative options.
6. I want to improve on my mind, body and spirit.
 * Hike or walk at least once a week.
 * **Jouranl every day.**
 * **Meditate every day.** Before breakfast is generally a good time to meditate. 

I don't think this list is exhaustive. I am motivated. I have a lot of ambitions. I have excluded my chess goal, as it is not a prioirty in my life anymore. It's a form of relaxation. We'll see where this goes. I am excited to start these fancy goals starting now.

### Mental Pain: 0 Physical Pain: 1.0 Sleep Hours: 12:00 PM ~ 8:00 AM

[8:59 PM] I haven't written in almost a month. But I feel rejuvenated. In fact, I don't know where to begin to keep things updated. School's out, and the Summer has started. I have a whole bunch of new goals set out to achieve, and they are primarily focused around self-betterment. So that way, I can be even happier. I believe that the Summer is the time of the year to get stronger. It's the off-season. It's when you achieve things you weren't able to in the regular season. I'm sure I can create a much longer list, but (and they need to be a little bit more concrete), but here they are for now. 

* Wake up at 4:30 AM
* Meditate Daily
* Stretch
* Handstand pushups
* Max out on fitness goals: bench press, diamond pushups, dips, curls, leg raises (in order)
* Learn basic jazz guitar progressions and master chords
* Lower BMI (No artificial sugar diet for at least the month of May)
* Chess.com rating improvement (to 1500 by the end of the summer)
* Research accomplishments: At least come close to finishing two papers
* Journal more often
* Become frugal

And here are my daily reminders:

* Kinder everyday
* Stronger everyday 
* Tell your friends you love them
* Because they love you 
* Determinism plus randomness

### Mental Pain: 1.0 Physical Pain: 0.5 Sleep Hours: 10:00 PM ~ 6:00 AM

[11:29 AM] I meditated for the first time in days. It feels like a crowning achievement. There are a few things I wanted to write about, but haven't been unable to to do so for whatever reason. A couple days ago, I wanted to write about my dear friends Kaya and AJ. They sent me a blanket that feels like God's personal tuck job. They also sent me a nice card reminding me of how much thye love me. I love them so much. I sent them a gift card to a fancy Italian restaurant in return for their extremely kind gesture. I don't know where I would be without them.

I feel sleepy today. Slightly tired. Disoriented. I woke up super early to get some work done. It wasn't successful. I've been wanting to write more, but now that I have some time to write and think for myself, I feel like I don't have much to talk about. My mood is okay. It's not great, but it's okay. Neither is my back pain. I am starting to believe that I will never regain flexibility in my body. 

Today, I will be meeting with a famous cancer research scientist. But I don't know what to dreally say to him. I don't know.

[10:22 PM] Tomorrow, I would like to write in depth about being broken.

## April 9, 2019
### Mental Pain: 1.0 Physical Pain: 1.0 Sleep Hours: 10:00 PM ~ 7:30 AM

[1:14 PM] There is still tenderness in my body. My muscles have not fully healed. It's unfortunate, but what can I do. I received a beautiful gift from Kaya and AJ yesterday. They sent a card too actually, It came last Friday, but the instructions told me not to open until I received the gift. They sent something called "bamboo blanket," which feels like God's tuck job. 

## April 8, 2019
### Mental Pain: 1.0 Physical Pain: 1.0 Sleep Hours: 10:00 PM ~ 7:30 AM

[3:03 PM] I used to write as a coping mechanism. But now that I'm feeling better on most days, I don't know if I have much to write anymore. I failed to write and meditate the last two days. Is it a sign that I don't need help anymore? I don't think I've fully healed. But I think I'm doing a much better job not caring about anything. That seems to be positive. 

I got to talk to my buddy, Nick, yesterday. It was fun catching up. We talked about things we could do as a substitute for his bachelor's party, which I feel obligated to throw. Hiking in Vancouver sounds like a swell idea.

[4:11 PM] I got to talk to my walking buddy today, although it was super brief. My partner in crime, Matt, who does everything with me at school, failed to show up today. I felt a bit lonely. In a surprsing turn of events, muscle pain is back to some degrees. I don't know why. But I have some tenderness in my back and right leg. I don't think I'm feeling the finest today

[9:27 AM] I was scheduled to go on another walk with my new walking buddy this morning, but she had to cancel because she wasn't feeling well. I wasn't disappointed though. I felt perfectly okay, actually. We'll walk again some other time. So, here I am at the usual cafe, typing away. I was going to get a chai, but made a conscious decision to just get a healthier alternative: tumeric-ginger tea. I ended up spilling boiling hot tumeric-ginger tea all over hand, however. I didn't feel any pain, but it also wasn't fun. Oh well. It's perfectly sanitizied now.

### Mental Pain: 0.5 Physical Pain: 0 Sleep Hours: I can't remember 

[5:21 AM] I don't really have much to say today. I received a card from my dear friend, Kaya, which filled me with joy. But the instructions on the card said not to open until I received another package from her. So there's that. I got a haircut, and got to talk to my barber. It was great. It was just a great day overall. I guess if there is one wish, it would be for the weather to be a bit nicer so I can go on walks.

### Mental Pain: 0.5 Physical Pain: 0 Sleep Hours: 11:00 PM ~ 7:30 AM

[11:51 AM] Just had another session with Mr. Rogers. We had another guided meditatoin session, but this time was we focused on being mindful of every part of our body. It was relaxing. We also talked about my weird sleeping habit these days. He didn't seem concerned, since it's been going on for only short term.

Mr. Rogers is such a unique guy. He told me today that he's very much a "mind-body-spirit" kind of perosn, as if I couldn't tell. I like it. I love the idea of an old atheist like myself embracing spirituality. Like Sam Harris says, we could be spiritual without being religious...

I feel somewhat spiritual today. I'm writing this moments after our session, on an outdoor bench table, looking over a lot green terrain. It's cloudy at the momemt, but warm enough for me to sit outside and marvel at nature wearing a fleece jacket. 

## April 3, 2019
### Mental Pain: 0.5 Physical Pain: 0 Sleep Hours: 10:00 PM ~ 7:30 AM

[11:02 AM] I woke up much later than usual. It's deeply concerning, especially as I like to boast about being an early bird. I guess I could chalk it up as fatigue from a hard work out the night before, but it seems like a lame excuse. I did wake up much joyful than yesterday, so that's a positive. I got some work done after a quick shower, and went to the usual cafe for a tea and some strawberry scone. Both were delicious. I've been refraining from drinking coffee lately, and have been successful at it for  10 days consecutive days. I feel more human without the constant excess caffeine. Oh, and I also forgot to meditate yesterday.

I wrote a long journal yesterday in one of my classes. I randomly recalled a story about my best friend that left me teary-eyed. It took a lot to not cry in-class, but I managed to pull it off. Here is the writing (which I edited heavily today):

> My best friend, Bri, maintains a beautiful blog online, where she finds whimsy and pleasantaries in things in life that sometimes go unappreciated. She writes about the long walks she goes on with her husband (who is a friend of mine). She writes about her aging grandparents and the magical learning experiences that come with being around sage adults who have lived quadruple her lifetime. She writes about her past life, her 3rd grade students, her brother, Nick, and just about anything that you can think of. She turns these moments into life lessons full of whimsy and gratitude. It never ceases to amaze me how she sees the good in everything and anything. She and her blog are endless sources of inspiration for me. And this is all coming from someone who does not actively practice meditation or mindfulness. She is able to catch these moments in life with such ease and transform them to powerful memories. Isn't that in some ways more beautiful than mindfulness? Call me disgusting, but I envy her for this, as I am a jealous, petty, stupid person who is explicitly pursuing all her qualities through the self-imposed practice of mindfulness.
>
> Bri and Nick are perfect human beings, and I'm so lucky to be able to even call them my best friends. In my tumultuous years of late teens and early twenties, no one stuck by me to gave me unconditional support and love like those two. They never for once let my annoyance and stupidity wane on our friendships. Not once, even in my dumbest and lowest points of my life. Take this for an example. For my 18th birthday, Bri baked me gorgeous, decadent, dark chocolate cake with white frosting on top. The frosting was hand-piped in blue and read, "Happy Birthday, Chris!" with a violin next to it. It must have taken her days to design, bake,  build, carve, and craft it. To do this date, it was the nicest thing someone has ever done for me. To provide even more context of my life at the time, I was living by myself in a crappy apartment, and I was often foodless, and barely surviving. In the most extreme fashion, she went out of her way to care for me. And when Bri handed me the cake, I said, "Fuck you." I wanted to say, "Thank you, this is the nicest thing someone has ever done for me. I love you." But I said, "Fuck you." This memory haunts me, and every time I think about it, I cry rivers inside. 
>
> I now know why I said those words. I just never learned how to express myself. When I was growing up, no one taught me how to understand human emotions. You know... Feelings. I had no role models who showed me the ropes.T here was no Mr. Rogers in my life to tell me it's okay to be happy, angry, or sad at times. No one taught me how to be kind, ethical, grateful, or any of the qualities that are deemed "good." No one taught me that life could be hard. What I had instead were siblings who I constantly fought with and an angry mother who thought yelling at kids constantly was tough, productive parenting. My human side of the kids was constantly suppressed, and our life focus was always oriented towards getting into good grades (and eventually a prestigious university). My brother grew to be emotionally abusive, which is why I have a forever-ruined relationship with him. When you place materialistic ambition to be of higher importance than familial love, care, and respect, the obvious end result is what you see in yours truly. No one taught me. One may think that I'm playing the blame game, but I promise that I'm not. I'm simply calling a spade and spade, and some people have more dysfunctional childhoods than others. I don't know where this is going now, but it's easy to see why I said what I said to Bri. I'm so undeserving to be friends with Bri and Nick. I love them so much.

[10:45 AM] I woke up rather angry today. I was disappointed with myself once again for failing to wake up earlier. The goal I'm trying to reach is 4:30 AM (as Jocko does and preaches). Also, my subconscious self was full of anger and jealousy, still thinking about _her_. I thought I had learned to use mindfulness to combat these thoughts, but apparently I hadn't and can't seem to utilize this when I'm asleep. Interesting. Because of the less than satisfactory start to my day, I had just been down. Just down and unsatisfied and lazy. I wish I could feel better today. Maybe some more mindfulness is what I need.

### Mental Pain: 0.5 Physical Pain: 0 Sleep Hours: 12:00 PM ~ 6:30 AM

[4:25 PM] I'm failing to wake up on time these days. It's a shame. Today has been an interesting day. Mundane in terms of accomplished work, but interesting in terms of mindfulness. I got some work done in the morning, meditated with Sam, had some meetings, and just carried on with my day. In my tutoring hours, I got to see my new walking buddy again which made me happy. But I also saw _her_ being obnoxiously loud and surrounded by a bunch of dudes an hour later. I had some moments of uneasiness, but I also for some reason, was able to practice mindfulness and successfully deflect my anxiety, jealousy, and depression that come with seeing _her_ with other people. I was so happy to see my days of training have finally come through. I even felt kinder today. I interacted with the _guy_ _she_ is into these days and was able to do so compassionately. I wasn't jealous. I was just kind to him. I don't know. 

[1:37 PM] My best friend Bri maintains a beautiful blog.

[6:17 PM] The world is so crazy. It's so full of beautiful people and shitty people. I made a friend today and also discovered that someone who I thought could be a friend to be a shitty one. I will save the shitty story for later, however.

A classmate of mine and I were to tackle a programming assignment. She is someone who comes a different with a background that is completely unlike mine. A polar opposite human being. We met up at the cafe that I frequent to work on the assignment. When nothing seemed clear or near, we gave up. Both exhausted from staring at computer screen, out of the blue, I asked if she wanted to go for a walk (after all it was a beautiful day, at almost 60 degrees). To much of my surprise, she happily agreed. What was supposed to be a 10 minute walk around a short trail, turned into a long loop around town, two loops around town, and another loop on a trail we had never taken or seen before. We chatted endlessly, as if we were catching up as old friends. It was a beautiful moment, and I discovered a new found appreciation for this classmate of mine. I am grateful to be her new friend, and a new walking buddy. It's rare moments like this when I can I fall in love with life again.

[8:27 AM] I overslept today. Not good. 

[6:55 PM] My day started slow. I was feeling a bit down, so I went straight to the cafe to work on my programming assignment. I didn't finish. I left the cafe, and went to the nearest pet store to pick up cat food. That didn't change the overall mood of my day. When I got home, I bummed around, went to the taco truck, and ate on the balcony. While I was eating, I got to look at my house entrance way from a new angle. I noticed that the ground was covered in months and months of fall leaves, now wet and dirty. I also realized that my small gardening areas were not even visible because of the bed of leaves. At that moment, I got this brilliant idea that I'm going to buy a rake, cleanup the walkway, and tend to my garden. At that moment, I became a master gardener. I drove to the nearest nursery to buy all sorts of seeds. Then I spent the next 3 hours sowing and cleaning the garden in the sun, all the while blasting some House M.D. soundtracks and Latino vibes. I was sweaty and tired, but it was worth every dollar and sweat and most of all, it was truly magical. It was magical to think about all the herbs that I could yield, all the flowers I could prune, and all the bees that I could bring. It was magical to remember one of Johan Hari's stories about a medical clinic in East London that treated patients suffering from depression by creating a collective job of tending to a garden. It was magical to imagine all the possible beauties of nature that could arise from my garden. It was magical.

## March 29, 2019
### Mental Pain: 1.5 Physical Pain: 0 Sleep Hours: 12:00 PM ~ 5:30 AM

[10:31 AM] My beautiful, kind, and caring friend Kaya called me last night. It was the highlight of my day. She called to just check in on things, like my mental health. She is someone who I can relate to on many levels, with things such as chronic depression and anxiety. And it's thanks to her that I finally decided to reach out for professional help this week. We talked for an hour about everything from my mental health, the nightmare of the sequence of events that led to my current, deep-seated depression, my Mr.Rogers therapist, her future plans with her boyfriend (who is my best friend), his improving cooking skills, etc... It was just a perfect conversation that I desperately needed. I just felt an immense amount of gratitude and it brought colors to my world. Despite the best efforts, sometimes you forget how lucky you are to have friends who love you. I should be grateful and honor their love by loving them back. Endlessly! I could burst out in tears at any moment right now, and I can't wait for my big appointment with Mr. Rogers.

I guess today's theme is gratitude. Here's a passage from one of Sam Harris' meditation app lessons on gratitude that I really like (I listened to it over and over again this morning!)
>
> There are at least a billion people on earth at this moment who would consider their prayers answered if they could trade places with you. There are at least a billion people who are suffering debilitating pain, or political oppression, or the acute stages of bereavement.
>
> To have your health—even just sort-of. To have friends—even only a few. To have hobbies or interests, and the freedom to pursue them. To have spent this day free from some terrifying encounter with chaos is to be lucky. Just look around you, and take a moment to feel how lucky you are. You get another day to live on this earth. Enjoy it.

[3:38 PM] Mr. Rogers was 10 minutes late to the appointment, and by then I was already in desperation mode. I had seen _her_ laughing with another opposite-sex friend an hour prior, which drove me destitute, and found myself seeking Sam Harris' help once again. Mr. Rogers had already made a negative impression last time with the constant checking of his watch, and now he was late to helping this damn, messed up soul. 

But it turns out I had no reason to fret about. While we ran short on therapy time due to delayed start, he was quick to identify all my problems, including my inability to forgive myself, and have endless chain of thought. He offered techniques for reprogramming our preconceived notion on how to deal with problems and reassessing readjusted beliefs. I am to keep a daily log of whenever I fall into these endless loops. 

But the highlight of the session was when he brought up mindfulness as a tool to be cognizant of our thoughts. Of course mindfulness and meditation are skills I have been trying to master myself for a while (with no avail), but it made a world of a difference, when he brought it up and led the discussion himself. I was truly surprised to see that meditation is used in a professional psychotherapy session, but heck, what do I know? I just couldn't be happier. I was ecstatic. He led the guided meditation for 20 minutes, and it was magical. He was reading off of a script, but it wasn't anything like what's offered on Sam Harris' meditation app. And believe me, I'm a total Sam Harris fan boy. I truly felt like I was having a spiritual moment with my consciousness, where my mind could travel to any time and space Mr. Rogers asked me to go. He asked me to sit by a river, under a tree, with my back against the tree trunk. I obliged, and smelled the tree, the river, the grass. I smelled Snoqualmie Falls.

At the end of the session, I felt like I could see colors again, and my scatter-brained self had calmed down. I was no longer fuming in jealousy and outrage over seeing _her_ with another guy (that I'm certain now she's interested in). But instead, I could smell and see colors. My mind still does wander, but now I feel empowered enough to catch my thought, and revert back to empty normalcy, if needed. It was a magical first session.

Mr. Rogers for sure is not without flaws. He hardly gave me space to talk. But it was all okay, because I felt healed. I'm probably jumping the gun, and cursing myself with this pouring of positivity, but I can't deny that I'm happy and full of optimism.

I am grateful for Brian.

[8:24 AM] It's almost like I can see foresee whether I'll have a good day or a bad one. I woke up feeling the storm. Just a usual endless thoughts of regret and jealousy. 

I talked to my friend Niki on the phone yesterday for our weekly mental health check-ins. She is so kind and caring. For someone who is a few years younger than, she is so much wiser and more mature. We talked about my horrendous week, dictated by the steroid. She gave me medical advice that my sports doc failed to mention. She told me to keep track of my schedule, because prescriptions often have debilitating effects on the circadian rhythm. So, I'm keeping track of them now. We also talked about how to fight loneliness. Like the song by Wilco. 

I'm in class. I should be teaching, but instead I'm writing here. I'm such a shitty person. I texted Kaya because of the mental pain. I haven't heard back yet.

[11:14 AM] The storm is strong at the moment. I don't know what to do in my office other than feeling hopeless. Gotta say my prayer to myself:

>  _No mas_
>
>  Be kinder
>
>  Be stronger
>
>  Tell your friends you love them
>
>  Because they love you
>
>  Determinism + Randomness

[1:10 PM] I spent my entire linear algebra class doodling and writing a help letter to Theo Von. It goes something like, 

> Mr. Kurnatowski,
>
> Tell me it's going to be okay
> 
> Tell me it's okay to be human
>
> Because I can't stop being sad.
>
> Mr. Kurnatowski,
>
> I was alone, this past weekend 
>
> I lost my mind this past weekend
>
> so give me that hitter on Monday.

I don't know. It sucks. But I don't know what else I should be doing. 

[3:45 PM] I was having severe anxiety and depression, so out of pure whim, I decided to open up Sam Harris' Waking Up meditation app that I hadn't used since probably last December. It was just a 10 minute guided meditation, but the effect was profound, and I'm so glad I did it. I feel calmer. More conscientous. Freer. It's embarassing that I failed to remember the stark impact meditaiton has on one's life. It's so important to take a few minutes out of your day for yourself, and meditaiton is the tool to do that. Why didn't I do this yesterday? The day before? Whenever I was feeling the storm? I look at the damn phone every single minute already! I feel like I can go on with my day now. Wow. What a change. I can't wait to meditate tomorrow.

[12:21 PM] I had no time this morning to feel either pains. I had to teach in the morning and I checked into the school counseling clinic. My guy's name is Brian. He's a Mr. Rogers doppelganger. Dresses exactly like him too, minus the sweater. The sneakers are the ultimate prop. Also has the same cadence. Anyway. We just did an assessment today. He asked some questions, and I answered. Pretty standard stuff. One thing that bothered me about Brian is that he kept looking at his watch shamelessly, but other than that, he was fine. He will be my therapist moving forward. 

I think I'm happy about the fact that my therapist is a guy. My old therapist was a lady, and at times I felt like I couldn't share certain things with her. I felt like I could spill anything today, so I think that's a good thing.

[8:02 AM] I woke up with no pain this morning. Just a little sad with life. I'm supposed to be on meloxicam from now on, but I don't see the point of taking it. I have no pain. 

[10:41 AM] I ended up taking meloxicam. I changed my mental pain from 4 to 5 and physical pain from 0.5 to 1.0. I'm even unhappier now. There is stiffness in my lower body, and my muscles are noticeably tight. I hate admitting it, but maybe these are just signs of aging, as the sports doctor mentioned. I'm 27 now. The latter half of the twenties. I should be in the decline from peak physical shape. It's only natural, and I hate that so much.

[5:05 PM] I talked in length with my best friend's girlfriend, Kaya. She is a dear friend of mine, who happens to receive professional therapy. She is is very knowledgeable of what I'm going through and convinced me to search for a therapist. And by this time, I was already feeling a lot of mental pain (changed the number from 5 to 6 now). The girl of my romantic interest, seemingly has forgiven me for the crime I committed. But now, she seems to have interest in another guy. Being a petty and jealous and awful human being that I am, this was a just a straight up crucification of mental health for me. 

[11:15 PM] I spent hours talking to my friends. I had to fight the storm, so once again, I went running to my friends. I talked to Julian on the phone, and Google hungout with Hewett. I'm now feeling a little better. Jealousy, anger, the storm... they all seem to have settled down for a little bit. Now, I'm reminding myself the motto. 

>  _No mas_
>
>  Be kinder
>
>  Be stronger
>
>  Tell your friends you love them
>
>  Because they love you
>
>  Determinism + Randomness

After repeating these to myself, I feel like I got a little better at letting things go.

### Mental Pain: 4 Physical Pain: 1.5

[2:27 PM] I took the last dose of steroid this morning. I have been incredibly unhappy about the effects of the steroid the last couple days, so I'm glad it's finally over. Upon prescribing the drug, the sports doc failed to mention all the side effects that comes with this particular steroid, one of them being incredible mood swings. And I'm already addicted to depression.

[4:30 PM] I napped, woke up, walked to the cafe, had a scone, and came back. It's my desperate attempt to spark and motivate myself to work. Oof. I don't think the storm is going away any time soon. But I feel calmer than this morning. It's probably because I took a nap. I don't know.

### Mental Pain: 3 Physical Pain: 3

[12:59 PM] I'm at a cafe. It's really the only cafe I go to that's not on campus. It's close from home, and you have to cross a really cute bridge to get there. Coffee happens to be cheap, so that's an added perk. My mental pain went up this morning. As expected, yesterday was just a day. I hadn't weathered the storm, and the "sun" was just a tease in the clouds. The uncontrollable happiness was probably just a side effect of the steroid. I'm in the tapering phase of the prescription right now, so I feel the effect of steroid less and less. Perhaps that's why mental pain has gone up. There seems to be an inverse relationship.

I'm not happy that my muscles have not healed yet. There is still a non-insignificant amount of pain in the back, and I worry that this may become a chronic condition. I already have a permanently messed up right shoulder because I was in a fight once. And when I say fight, I don't mean the one where both parties beat the crap out of each other until one comes out on top. I mean the one where one guy lets the other guy punch him until the guy who didn't throw punches falls down. I was that one guy. It was at a pickup hockey game in 2016, when an idiot decided to attack me for no reason, and I decided to practice Penn Jillette's extreme pacifism. I ate punches and walked out feeling proud for my abstinence from retaliation. That's how I ended up with a permanently damaged shoulder. I hope I don't end up with a permanently damaged back. Hunchbacks just aren't cool. 

Elaborating on the mental pain, I feel that I've fallen into the attractor of guilt once again. It's the cycle of regret that has tormented me for weeks now. Endlessly reminding myself of the shame and guilt of being a "less than a decent man." Endlessly dreaming of new sequences of events that would have avoided all the pain and turmoil. Endlessly imagining things that will never come true. 

It's hard to break out of the cycle. No. I don't know if I ever can and will as long as the climate is still "stormy." I did develop a few techniques to temporarily overcome the attractor though. I read and reread Jocko's poem over and over again. And then, I read out loud my daily reminders:

>  _No mas_
>
>  Be kinder
>
>  Be stronger
>
>  Tell your friends you love them
>
>  Because they love you
>
>  Determinism + Randomness

Today is just another hard day. Despite the relatively low level of mental pain, it feels so much worse given the mental health peak from yesterday. We'll see where today leads me.

[3:22 PM] I can't get myself to work. Although, I'm listening to a lot of music out in the balcony again, trying to soak up some of the last glimmer of sun, I guess. I changed my mental pain level from 2 to 3. Now I'm more than convinced that I didn't even come close to weathering the storm. It was just a single tornado gone by. I can see a bigger storm coming a mile away, and I'm terrified.

### Mental Pain: 0.5 Physical Pain: 3.5

[2:24 PM] Do I dare say that my depression is completely gone? Definitely not. But I'm in a great place right now. Much better mental place than the last few weeks. It's 55 degrees, sunny, absolutely beautiful, and I wish I could share with the whole world. I'm soaking up the sun in my balcony, sitting on something called "wicker" chair. It's a southern style wooden chair with a back support that is woven from wicker material. My feet are resting on a dusty trash can. I'm also sipping on some canned, pink grapefruit Perrier in between typing. Is this what happiness is? I don't know, but I feel good. Amazingly good. It's only one day, but I feel like I found the metaphorical "sun" Jocko was referring to. I've weathered the storm. And now, I'm enjoying my day just typing away. What has changed? I wish I knew. 

I'm still having a hard time focusing though. I believe the steroid is the main culprit. My brain is operating at the speed of light, and I can't formulate sentences that are longer than 10 words. Plus, the back pain is still there. It's odd. I would've bet all of my life's savings that I would've started recovering from the physical injury faster than the mental one. Now, I'm not saying that I'm healed. I don't doubt for a second that the storm will come back later today or sometime this weekend, when I'm alone. But all I want to do right now is just enjoy my little moment of sun. And in 10 minutes, I will head out for a quick skate, possibly for the last time this season. Spring is here.

### Mental Pain: 2.5 Physical Pain: 4

[4:58 PM] The steroid is causing problems for me. I got very little sleep the last two days. Tuesday night, I must have slept for about 5 hours. Last night, I slept for less than 3. The physical pain was mostly absent in the morning, but resurfaced in the afternoon. I had to head home earlier than I hoped because of the pain. 

[9:04 PM] I'm in a much better place today. Mentally stronger. Happier. And I feel like I can finally sleep.

### Mental Pain: 5.5 Physical Pain: 2

With the new steroid treatment, I've been feeling very little pain. One side-effect, however, seems to be heightened sense of awareness, and that's just a euphemism for no sleep. I couldn't sleep last night. I was awake until 2:00 AM, which is unacceptably late for me. But an unexpected positive outcome of that was that I ended up listened to hours and hours of Jocko Willink podcast and found a gem that put me in a better headspace.

>  The storm that you’re in, it is hard to see out of that storm. It’s hard to see past it. It seems like the storm is everything. But the storm is not everything. And it won’t last forever. You can get out of the storm, and you will get out of the storm. And when you get out… you’re gonna see the sun, again.

> But right now, you’re being tried. You’re being forged. You’re being tested by fire and by pain. That’s the test. Don’t fail the test. Don’t fail the test. Don’t give in. Don’t quit. Don’t ever quit.

> Fight on. Fight through the storm. Fight through the pain, and come out the other side stronger and tougher and better. A fighter. A survivor. A winner. Victorious. And free from that storm. Free from the darkness. Free.

What a beaut. I created a poster of this for my room with some other stuff. 

I cried in my office this morning. My friend, Krittika, is a gentle soul and happens to be the girlfriend of my best friend. She and I have a lot in common including our constant search for better mindfulness, so we text each other frequently. Being a concerned, kind, caring person that she is, she inquired about how I was doing. So I spilled everything. We talked about when my recent struggles began. When things got really bad. What happened with the _girl_, and how I am repenting for my sins. I told her that I can't function like a normal. I sought advice from her. I also told her that I loved her and her boyfriend (my best friend) dearly. I cried as I was typing those words. I love my friends so much. Sometimes I feel like an ungrateful bastard because I take my friends for granted, and fail to realize that they will always be there for me. There is a reason why this journal/blog/thing(?) is called "myfriendsloveme."

Once I got home, I lied in bed and stared at the ceiling for a good hour. I didn't think of anything particular. I just lied there. I was just happy that I wasn't at school and was home at a quiet place where I could rest my head and back. My cat, Billy, comforted my chest and the crotch meanwhile. After an hour of empty staring, I decided to lift. I was trying to play a mental mind trick on myself that the methylprednisolone I'm taking helps with body building. I'm a 133 lb toothpick so I need to lift and get bigger. I did 4 sets of bench press at 80 lbs. I don't remember the rep count. I sucked. 

[3:35 PM] I decided that I should start time stamping to organize thoughts chronologically. When I'm writing, I'm like a kid on adderall. I just write whatever pops into my head. Like. I'm gonna write about how I'm expecting a call from Niki at 5:00 PM. I'm expecting a call from Niki at 5:00 PM. I think I'm gonna walk around a bit before the phone call. It's nice outside.

### Mental Pain: 5.5 Physical Pain: 4

I woke up very late today. I set the alarm for 5:30 AM, but was only able to defeat the seductiveness of my bed at 8:00 AM. That's very late for me. It's 9:20 AM now, and I am anxiously waiting for the transit bus to come. My mental pain is not as severe this morning. It's either that it's too early for me to tell, or I'm still psychologically drained from yesterday. Yesterday was so full of emotions, and my tiny brain is exhausted. We'll see how things go from here. The sports doctor's appointment is at 10:05 AM. I should be heading out now.  

This sports doc turned out to be my new favorite person. She was late to my appointment, but she was quick, punctual, very knowledgeable and attractive. The last characterization is always a plus no matter who you are. She told me to stop taking muscle relaxers and ditch the physical therapy. I was ecstatic to hear that since I never got along with Brandon (is that his name?) to begin with. Instead, she prescribed me some bomb-ass steroids (I don't know the real clinical name of the drug) to treat what I finally know my problem as "lumbar strain." My mood has really uplifted since the minute I swallowed them delicious tablets. I didn't arrive at the verge of tears by the the time 4 o'clock rolled around like yesterday, and I had enough energy left to continue tutoring kids. Pain was manageable all day. 

During the tutoring hours, I talked to the _girl_ who has been one of my deepest sources of depression. I was worried she wouldn't talk to me for all the terrible stuff I did to her. It was our first encounter in two weeks, (when things got really heated), but we had a very cordial small chat. I think that constitutes as a happy closure in our acquaintanceship. That felt alright, and now I don't have to worry about her hating me eternally.

Another thing that I did today was e-mail my old therapist. I shot her an e-mail asking if she offered counseling over virtual conferencing. I have yet to hear back from her. I loved Michele. She knew all about my fucked up history, like how I had a fetish for girls in relationships, my burgeoning drinking problems and how I was molested in 1st grade.

I got home at 6:00 PM and noticed that my Washburn was going through depression as well. Well. I guess I don't play him as much as I used to, so he's obviously lonely. I only know and compose sad, four-chord songs, so I figured it's not good for my sanity to continue my relationship with him. Besides, I can't muster any strength on my fingertips to hold down 'em dirty-old-perverted steel strings. And I don't have the drive to learn new chord progressions. I've been hoping to learn Jazz guitar, but I just suck at life right now.

Overall, I felt today was a good day. I regained some of my sanity and strength. I'm starting to speculate that maybe the physical pain in one's body is a huge, if not, the biggest driving factor in one's mental pain. Maybe.

### Mental Pain: 9.5 Physical Pain: 7

I panicked hard today. So, I reached out to a few friends on the phone and spam messaged a few others. And guess what? They all happen to love me. My genius soon-to-be-doctor friend, Niki, told me to keep track of levels of mental and physical pain daily. Hence, the numbers followed by the date. My angelic friend, Bri, writes so beautifully. Her writing makes me cry often. She inspired me to add some body of text followed by the numbers. Her twin brother, Nick, is a role model for me. He's moving to a new apartment with his fiancee soon, and I showed my excitement for his new chapter in life. My ever-hilarious, optimist friend, Hewett, took time out of his busy work schedule to play a childish mobile game with me. That was so kind of him. My sweet friend, Julian, is gay. He was the last person I talked to today. He wants to me check out a therapist messaging service that I don't necessarily trust.

I suffered a severe back muscle spasm exactly 8 days ago. I still haven't recovered from it. I've been going to a series of doctor's appointments and started attending physical therapy. I have to say, I don't really like my physical therapist, Brandon (I can't remember if that's even his name). 

I suffer from chronic depression, but these past few weeks have really hit it hard for me. But I think that's a story for another time. This daily summary is getting too long. So I guess this is a journal, but not really because that wasn't my intention. Whatever.

I want to get better. I want my back to heal faster, and I want to be free of this thing called depression that's haunted me all my life. I'm not sure if writing helps in any way, but I'm willing to give it a try.
